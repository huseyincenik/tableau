## Introduction
Welcome to the **Pizza Sales Performance Tracker Project**! This project is all about exploring the fascinating world of Pizza Sales through SQL queries and visualizing the data using Tableau. Here, I'll provide an overview of my journey, the project's key components, and how to access all related files.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Database Creation
### Data Source
- **Source:**[Pizza Sales Data](https://github.com/huseyincenik/tableau/blob/main/Projects/Pizza%20Sales%20(%20Tableau%20%26%20SQL%20)%20/Dataset/pizza_sales.csv)
- **Database Platform:** Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
- **Description:** I initiated the project by setting up a dedicated database in MSSQL to house the sales data.

### 2. Data Import
- **Data Source:** Sales data
- **Description:** I imported the raw sales data into the MSSQL database for further analysis.

### 3. SQL Analysis
- **Approach:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the database using SQL queries.
- **Insights:** Gained valuable insights into pizza sales trends and patterns.

### 4. Tableau Integration
- **Tools:** Utilized Tableau to seamlessly connect to the MSSQL server.
- **Purpose:** Prepared the data for visualization within Tableau's dynamic environment.

### 5. Data Visualization
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau
- **Dashboards:** Created two intricate dashboards featuring slider charts, donut charts, butterfly charts, bar charts, area charts, and KPIs.
- **Dynamic Structures:** Implemented dynamic structures to enhance user experience.
- **Drill-Down:** Users can drill down for more detailed insights.

### 6. Adding Dynamism with Actions
- **Enhancement:** To provide a more dynamic experience, I incorporated various actions and created calculated fields.
- **Benefits:** This allows users to interact with the data, gain deeper perspectives, and explore insights dynamically.

### 7. Overlay
## Overlay (Info) Process
In my project, I utilized another dataset in Tableau to add an extra layer and enrich the information. This step played a significant role in making the data more meaningful and impactful.

### Data Source
- **Source:** [Overlay Data](https://github.com/huseyincenik/tableau/blob/main/Projects/Pizza%20Sales%20(%20Tableau%20%26%20SQL%20)%20/Dataset/Data%20Overlay%20-%20Sheet1.csv)
- **Description:** This dataset was used to add additional information to the core pizza sales data.

### Overlay Process
- **Steps:** For the overlay process, I followed these steps:
  1. Data was imported and related.
  2. Relevant fields were identified, and matching data was created.
  3. It was integrated into the visualization in Tableau.
  4. The result allowed the integration of richer and more detailed information into the project.

This additional data layer enhanced the depth of the project and enabled users to access more information.


### 8. Project Report
- **Documentation:** Prepared a detailed report summarizing the entire project.
- **Insight Sharing:** Documented the journey, findings, and methodologies.
