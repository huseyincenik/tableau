# Video Game Sales Units Analysis - Using Tableau

This project has been developed to analyze and visualize video game sales units using Tableau. The dataset can be found under the title "2020/W45: Dedicated Video Game Sales Units" on [data.world](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/data-sets-2020/).

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the dataset using Tableau.
- Perform feature engineering on the dataset.
- Pivot the data by years to display it in a single column.
- Create a Makeover Monday Dashboard showing Hardware and Software unit values by regions.
- Use KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to display the total Hardware and Software unit values.

## Project Steps

1. Data Preparation: As the first step, I prepared the dataset for use in Tableau. In this stage, I split the data and applied feature engineering.

2. Data Visualization: I pivoted the data by years and displayed it in a single column. Then, I created Bar, Pie, and KPI pages to visualize the data.

3. Key Performance Indicator (KPI): I used KPI on the dashboard to highlight total Hardware and Software unit values.

4. Makeover Monday Dashboard: I created the central dashboard of the project. The dashboard displays Hardware and Software unit values by regions and provides visual insights.

## Project Screenshots

Below are the screenshots of the Makeover Monday Dashboard I created:
